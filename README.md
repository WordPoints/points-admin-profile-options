# Points Admin Profile Options [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WordPoints/points-admin-profile-options.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/WordPoints/points-admin-profile-options) [![HackerOne Bug Bounty Program](https://img.shields.io/badge/security-HackerOne-blue.svg)](https://hackerone.com/wordpoints)

Hello! This is where we develop the Points Admin Profile Options integration extension that you 
can [download from WordPoints.org](https://wordpoints.org/extensions/points-admin-profile-options/). 

This extension restores the points options to the admin profile screen after they were
[removed in WordPoints 2.5.0](https://github.com/WordPoints/wordpoints/issues/579).
